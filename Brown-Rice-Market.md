Rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals, brown rice became a staple in the diets of health-conscious consumers. Some notable trends during this period included:</p><ul> <li><strong>Health and Wellness Trends:</strong> Consumers increasingly sought out plant-based and gluten-free products, driving brown rice’s popularity. Its nutritional profile made it a preferred choice for those looking to reduce their intake of processed foods.</li> <li><strong>Rising Demand in Asia-Pacific:</strong> As demand for whole grains expanded in countries like China, India, and Japan, brown rice became more common in the region’s diets, traditionally dominated by white rice.</li> <li><strong>Sustainability Concerns:</strong> The environmental impact of white rice farming, particularly water usage, led some consumers to favor brown rice as a more sustainable alternative.</li></ul><p>Overall, global brown rice consumption increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.4% from 2018 to 2022.

This trend is supported by a continued rise in plant-based diets, where brown rice serves as an important carbohydrate source.</li> <li><strong>Increased Adoption of Sustainable Agricultural Practices:</strong> Advances in sustainable farming technologies and practices, such as water-efficient irrigation and organic rice production, are expected to make brown rice even more appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.</li> <li><strong>Innovation in Product Offerings:</strong> Brands are increasingly experimenting with brown rice-based products, including ready-to-eat meals, rice snacks, and gluten-free flour alternatives. These innovations are likely to drive demand in both established and emerging markets.</li> <li><strong>Rising Demand from North America and Europe:</strong> As the plant-based and gluten-free food movements continue to grow, countries in North America and Europe are expected to see increased consumption of brown rice, with millennials and Gen Z leading the charge.</li> <li><strong>Supply Chain Developments:</strong> Efforts to streamline the global brown rice supply chain, along with the development of new rice farming regions, will likely make the grain more accessible to international markets.</li></ul><p>By 2033, the global brown rice market is expected to exceed USD 28 billion, with a CAGR of approximately 5.0%.
